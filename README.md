# R-Cube

Hi! Do you love Rubik's cubes? Well, R-Cube is the best digital cube for you to play with!
R-Cube is a digital cube where you can solve a cube, but digitally! You can reset it any time you want. And the cool thing is that it is 3D and all for free! It is currently available on a Phone, and Windows 7-11. You can move it with a mouse and see it all in 3D! Isn't that amazing? We hope you try it out! Thanks!

# Open Source

Hi! We recently made R-Cube an open-source project! This would be great for developers who want to mod this game or see how the game works! With that in mind, we can finally publish beta releases. Their version listings will be formatted like so:

  beta version (next update version).(next minor update).(the beta version for that)
  
  ex:
  beta version 1.8.0.23
  
  ex:
  beta version 2.6.4.71

Please do not sell this product for any price without attribution.**
